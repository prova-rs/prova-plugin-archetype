--- The archetype's REGISTRY IDENTITY, held locally.
---
--- Registration into a prova package-registry is automated and credential-free: a reconcile loop
--- converges the registry onto the org's repos, and each repo dispatches on `release: published` for
--- latency. Both paths derive this archetype's `archetypes/<init_key>.toml` entry from the fields
--- declared in `archetype.yaml` — and both paths SKIP a repo that declares no `prova.init_key`, the
--- same way they skip a repo with no `[plugin]` manifest.
---
--- A skip is silent by design (most org repos are not archetypes), which is exactly the hazard: drop
--- or typo the declaration and this archetype quietly stops being registrable, with nothing red
--- anywhere. This proof is the local tripwire — the failure lands here, in the repo that owns the
--- declaration, instead of as an absence nobody notices in a registry.
---
--- It deliberately asserts only what the ENTRY is projected from. Whether `prova init project` then
--- resolves that key is prova's business, proven in its own suite
--- (`proofs/spec/registry/archetypes_test.lua`).
